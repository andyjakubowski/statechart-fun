Having fun with statecharts ðŸ“Ÿ

Statecharts were invented by [David Harel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harel) and described in this paper from 1987:
[STATECHARTS: A VISUAL FORMALISM FOR COMPLEX SYSTEMS](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf)

[XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) is a JavaScript framework that implements statecharts.
